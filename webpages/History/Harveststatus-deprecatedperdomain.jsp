--%><%-- This page handles showing harvest status and history for domains.
With no parameters, it gives an input box for searching that feeds back into
itself.
With parameter domainName, it performs a search.  Name can be a glob pattern
(using ? and * only) or a single domain.  If domains are found, they are
displayed, if no domains are found a message is shown.
