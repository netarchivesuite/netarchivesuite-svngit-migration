	The primary function of the NetarchiveSuite is to plan, schedule and
	archive web harvests of parts of the internet. We use Heritrix as our
	web-crawler. NetarchiveSuite was released on July 2007 as Open Source
	under the LGPL license and is used by the Danish organization
	Netarkivet.dk (
	<a href="http://netarkivet.dk">http://netarkivet.dk</a>). This
	organization has since July 2005 been using NetarchiveSuite to harvest
	Danish websites as authorized by the latest Danish Legal Deposit Act.
	<p>The NetarchiveSuite can organize three different kinds of
		harvests:
	<ul>
		<li>Event harvesting (organize harvests of a set of domains
			related to a specific event e.g. 9/11, Elections and so on).</li>
		<li>Selective harvesting (recurrent harvests of a set of
			domains).</li>
		<li>Snapshot harvesting (organizing a complete snapshot of all
			known domains).</li>
	</ul>
	The software has been designed with the following in mind:
	<ul>
		<li>Friendly to non-technicians - designed to be usable by
			librarians and curators with a minimum of technical supervision.</li>
		<li>Low maintenance - easy setup of automated harvests, automated
			bit-integrity checks, and simple curator tools.</li>
		<li>High bit-preservation security - replication and active
			integrity tests of large data contents.</li>
		<li>Loosely coupled - the suite consists of modules that can be
			used individually, or be used as one large web-archiving system.</li>
	</ul>
