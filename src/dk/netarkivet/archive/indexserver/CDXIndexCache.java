/**
 * A cache that serves CDX index files for job IDs.
 *
 * Notice that since data for some IDs may not be available, the actual
 * cached file might not correspond in its content to what was asked for.
 * For instance, if asking for data for IDs 2, 3, and 4, and 3 fails, a
 * cached file for IDs 2 and 4 will be returned.  There is currently no
 * way to tell if you got everything you asked for.
 *
 * This cache uses the Unix sort(1) command as an external process call,
 * as that one is optimized for handling large, disk-based sorts.
