 * This module gives access to previously harvested material, through a proxy solution.
 * <ul>

 *      archive with an index over URLs stored in the archive.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>Support for browsing an entire crawl (like a snapshot or event harvest) or a single job (what one machine
 *      harvested).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>Allows for collecting unharvested URLs while browsing, for use in curation, and to include these URLs in the
 *      next crawl.
