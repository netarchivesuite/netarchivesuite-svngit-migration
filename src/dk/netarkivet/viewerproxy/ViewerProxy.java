/**
 * Singleton of a viewerproxy.
 * The viewerproxy consists of:
 * - A JobIndexCache, which is able to retrieve a Lucene index file for a list
 *   of jobs
 * - An ArcRepositoryClient used by ARCArchiveAccess
 * - An ARCArchiveAccess, which retrieves objects from an ARC repository
 * - A MissingURIRecorder, which records missing urls
 * - A DelegatingController, which delegates commands to change index and handle
 *   missing url collection
 * - An NotifyingURLResolver, which looks up URLs in an ARCArchiveAccess,
 *   and notifies Observers about missing URLs,
 * - An UnknownCommandResolver, which generates an error for unknown command
 *   urls and pass on non-command urls to the NotifyingURLResolver
 * - A GetDataResolver, which handles certain command urls for getting raw data
 *   and pass on the rest to the UnknownCommandResolver,
 * - A HTTPControllerServer, which delegates certain command urls to a
 *   controller and pass on the rest to the GetDataResolver,
 * - A WebProxy, which listens for http requests, and sends them to the
 *   HTTPControllerServer
